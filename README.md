# PicoCTF2022-Writeup
For the sole purpose of proving people did stuff.  
On a side note... these are the writeups for the few questions we managed to complete.  
Side note x2: I don't think my team mates are going to add to this anymore but I'm going to also add in the questions that got solved *after* pico ended and be sad about the simplicity of some of them *cough* milk. Everything before [this commit](https://github.com/vivian-dai/PicoCTF2021-Writeup/commit/f6cacbebed610f80202bca05bcf10650cca189db) was solved before pico ended (if it matters)  

If you'd like to try some of these problems yourself, head on over to [PicoGym](https://play.picoctf.org/practice)!
